# web-scrapping-project
I take a random website for scrapping. I chose 7 columns like company name, ratings(3), reviews, company type, and benefits.
Finally, I have scrapped 500 pages using Python. All codes are uploaded. I did not edit any codes, the code looks totally raw.
I uploaded the outcome file (company.csv) too. Which contains 9900 rows and 7 columns(9900*7).
Thank you so much for visiting!
